# Idea #1 | Design Co-pilot

## üîé Idea overview

Designers create the design and design system, and the co-pilot can do routine tasks such as transferring this design to other pages where you don‚Äôt need to be creative just transfer this design. So you can act like a junior designer creating content based on created design. It leaves control to the designer but can augment and scale the activities.

## üí° Feature analysis
- **Approach #1 | Editing SVG elements**
    
    The system will allow users to edit the SVG UI elements by describing their desired changes in a text format, which will then be interpreted by a chatGPT-like system and applied to the SVG element.
    
    **Technology readiness**
    
    üü¢ Ready for implementation
    
    **Risks**
    
    üü° Moderate risk
    
    **Complexity**
    
    üü† Moderately complex
    
    **Technologies**
    
    Following [LLM for SVG editing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.06094.pdf) paper, the input can be an optimized SVG with text instructions to edit it. The language Model can be tuned on the created target dataset using raster-to-vector tools.

    **Pros and Cons**
    
    üü¢¬†Pros
    
    - Could leverage foundation models to generate decent raster image (if we choose the solution of raster-to-svg)
    - Have two state-of-the-art research solutions with different generative architectures for guidance
    - Have sufficient dataset
    
    üî¥¬†Cons
    
    - No respective open-source Github repo available for checking the performance of the research paper
    - Generation quality has the risk of not meeting the designer's requirements since there is limited research on SVG generation

- **Approach #3 | New layout generation**
    
    The system will take user input about the desired layout and generate a new page based on the existing elements. The idea is to utilize a top-down approach, first generating a layout, after - populating it with elements.

    **Pros and Cons**
    
    üü¢¬†Pros
    
    - The ability to generate new layouts based on user inputs and existing elements allows for highly adaptive and custom designs
    - The model generates a high-level layout based on the prompt, which would save computation cost and time for outputting full-length SVG with content.
    
    üî¥¬†Cons
    
    - No respective open-source Github repo is available for checking the performance of the research paper
    - Generation quality has the risk of not meeting the designer's requirements since there is limited research on SVG generation


## üèÅ Final recommendation

[A1] **Editing SVG elements** using a language model appears more feasible in the short term. On the other hand, [A3] **New layout generation** could potentially demonstrate higher effectiveness for the clients; however, the lack of research and existing methods may negatively influence the complexity of its potential implementation. Besides, [A2] **New component generation** with 2 suggested implementation processes is more complex.
