# Idea #1 | Design Co-pilot

## üîé Idea overview

Designers create the design and design system, and the co-pilot can do routine tasks such as transferring this design to other pages where you don‚Äôt need to be creative just transfer this design. So you can act like a junior designer creating content based on created design. It leaves control to the designer but can augment and scale the activities.

## üí° Feature analysis
### Approach #1 | Editing SVG elements
    
The system will allow users to edit the SVG UI elements by describing their desired changes in a text format, which will then be interpreted by a chatGPT-like system and applied to the SVG element.

| Technology readiness | Risks | Complexity |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| üü¢ Ready for implementation | <div style="width: 100pt"> üü° Moderate risk | <div style="width: 150pt"> üü† Moderately complex |


**Technologies**

Following LLM for SVG editing [[Paper](references/Research%20papers/LLM_for_SVG_Editing.pdf)], the input can be an optimized SVG with text instructions to edit it. The language Model can be tuned on the created target dataset using raster-to-vector tools.

üü¢¬†Pros

- Could leverage foundation models to generate decent raster image (if we choose the solution of raster-to-svg)
- Have two state-of-the-art research solutions with different generative architectures for guidance

### Approach #3 | New layout generation
    
The system will take user input about the desired layout and generate a new page based on the existing elements. The idea is to utilize a top-down approach, first generating a layout, after - populating it with elements. 

| Technology readiness | Risks | Complexity |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| üü° Some elements are available, but further development and research needed | <div style="width: 120pt"> üü° Moderate risk | <div style="width: 100pt"> üî¥ Complex |

**Technology**

Pre-process SVG layouts ‚Üí  Clean by place holding elements 
‚Üí Input to LLM Model 
‚Üí Model output high-level layout based on the prompt 
‚Üí Post-process by replacing placeholders with SVG 
‚Üí Output the final layout.

**Pros and Cons**

üü¢¬†Pros

- The ability to generate new layouts based on user inputs and existing elements allows for highly adaptive and custom designs
- The model generates a high-level layout based on the prompt, which would save computation cost and time for outputting full-length SVG with content.

üî¥¬†Cons

- No respective open-source Github repo is available for checking the performance of the research paper
- Generation quality has the risk of not meeting the designer's requirements since there is limited research on SVG generation

## üèÅ Final recommendation

[A1] **Editing SVG elements** using a language model appears more feasible in the short term. On the other hand, [A3] **New layout generation** could potentially demonstrate higher effectiveness for the clients; however, the lack of research and existing methods may negatively influence the complexity of its potential implementation. Besides, [A2] **New component generation** with 2 suggested implementation processes is more complex.
